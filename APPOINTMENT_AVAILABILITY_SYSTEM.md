# Appointment Booking System with Doctor Availability

## Date: October 21, 2025
## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Full appointment booking system implemented

## Overview
Implemented a complete end-to-end appointment booking system where:
1. ✅ Doctors can manage their availability (dates and time slots)
2. ✅ Patients can only book appointments with doctors who have available time slots
3. ✅ Doctors without availability show "Not Available" badge and disabled booking button
4. ✅ Patients select specific date and time from doctor's available slots
5. ✅ Booked time slots automatically removed from doctor's availability
6. ✅ Appointments stored in database with full tracking

## Database Changes

### 1. Doctor Profiles Table - New Column ✅ COMPLETE
**SQL to run in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Add availability column to doctor_profiles table
ALTER TABLE doctor_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS availability JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- Add index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_doctor_availability 
ON doctor_profiles USING GIN (availability);
```

**Data Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-10-21",
    "time_slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00", "14:00", "15:00"]
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-10-22",
    "time_slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "14:00"]
  }
]
```

### 2. Appointments Table - New Table ✅ COMPLETE
**SQL File:** `database/create_appointments_table.sql`

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_firebase_uid TEXT NOT NULL,
  doctor_firebase_uid TEXT NOT NULL,
  appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
  appointment_time TIME NOT NULL,
  appointment_type TEXT DEFAULT 'general-practitioner',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled', -- scheduled, completed, cancelled, no-show
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(doctor_firebase_uid, appointment_date, appointment_time)
);
```

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_appointments_patient` - Query patient's appointments
- `idx_appointments_doctor` - Query doctor's appointments
- `idx_appointments_date` - Filter by date
- `idx_appointments_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_appointments_doctor_date` - Composite for performance

**RLS Policies:**
- Patients can view/create/update their own appointments
- Doctors can view/update their appointments
- Auto-updated `updated_at` trigger
