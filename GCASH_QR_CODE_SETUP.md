# GCash QR Code Setup Instructions

## 📸 Step 1: Save Your QR Code Image

1. **Save the QR code image** you received from GCash Business
2. **Name it**: `gcash-qr-code.png`
3. **Save it to**: `src/assets/images/gcash-qr-code.png`

## 📁 File Structure

Your file structure should look like this:

```

  assets/
    images/
      gcash-qr-code.png  ← Your QR code image here
