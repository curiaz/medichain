**Verify:**
```bash
python fix_schema_cache.py
# Should show: ‚úÖ SCHEMA CACHE IS NOW WORKING!
```

## üìä MONITORING & LOGGING

### What to Monitor

#### Backend Logs
```bash
# Start backend and monitor
cd backend
python app.py

# Watch for:
- Appointment creation/update logs
- Doctor verification requests
- Email notification status
- Database connection errors
```

#### Database Queries
```sql
-- Monitor appointment creation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments;

-- Check doctor availability
SELECT firebase_uid, availability 
FROM doctor_profiles 
WHERE verification_status = 'approved';

-- Monitor verification requests
SELECT email, last_verification_request_sent, verification_status
FROM doctor_profiles
ORDER BY last_verification_request_sent DESC;
```

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Appointment creation fails
**Solution:** Run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` in Supabase

### Issue: Doctor availability not saving
**Check:**
1. Column exists: `SELECT availability FROM doctor_profiles LIMIT 1;`
2. Data format is valid JSON array
3. Service role key has write permissions

### Issue: Verification badge doesn't hide
**Check:**
1. `VerificationStatus.jsx` is imported correctly
2. CSS animations are loading
3. Browser cache cleared

### Issue: Email notifications not sending
**Check:**
1. Gmail credentials in `.env`
2. App password (not regular password)
3. Less secure app access enabled
