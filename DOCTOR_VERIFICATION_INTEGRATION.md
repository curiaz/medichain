## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### **Step 1: Doctor Signs Up**
```
Frontend (Doctor):
1. Fills signup form with:
   - Email, Password, Name
   - Specialization (e.g., "Cardiology")
   - Uploads verification document (license/ID)
2. Clicks "Create Account"

Backend:
3. Creates Firebase account
4. Saves document to: backend/uploads/doctor_verification/
5. Creates user_profiles record (role='doctor')
6. Creates doctor_profiles record (verification_status='pending')
7. Generates verification_token (expires in 24 hours)
8. Sends admin notification email 📧
9. Returns success to frontend

Doctor:
10. Sees message: "Your documents are under review"
11. Redirected to dashboard (can login but sees "Pending" badge)
```

---

### **Step 2: Admin Receives Email**
```
Admin Email (medichain173@gmail.com):
📧 Subject: "Doctor Verification Request - Dr. John Smith"

Email contains:
├─ Doctor's information (name, email, specialization)
├─ Attached verification document
├─ Two buttons:
│  ├─ ✅ APPROVE DOCTOR
│  └─ ❌ DECLINE APPLICATION
└─ Expiration: 24 hours
```

```

---

### **Step 3: Admin Clicks Approve/Decline**

#### **Option A: Admin Approves ✅**
```
Admin clicks "APPROVE DOCTOR" link:

Backend (/api/auth/verify/approve):
1. Validates verification_token
2. Checks token not expired (< 24 hours)
3. Updates doctor_profiles:
   - verification_status = 'approved'
   - verified_at = now()
   - verification_token = null (consumed)
4. Sends email to doctor 📧
5. Shows success page to admin

Doctor receives email:
📧 Subject: "MediChain Account Approved - Welcome!"

Email says:
✅ Congratulations! Your account has been verified.

You can now:
- Access your doctor dashboard
- Manage patient appointments
- Use AI-powered diagnostic tools
- Access secure medical records

[Login to Your Account] button
```

#### **Option B: Admin Declines ❌**
```
Admin clicks "DECLINE APPLICATION" link:

Backend (/api/auth/verify/decline):
1. Validates verification_token
2. Updates doctor_profiles:
   - verification_status = 'declined'
   - declined_at = now()
   - verification_token = null (consumed)
3. Sends email to doctor 📧
4. Shows decline page to admin

Doctor receives email:
📧 Subject: "MediChain Account Update"

Email says:
❌ Your verification was not approved.

Reason: [Admin can customize]

You can:
- Contact support for more information
- Resubmit with additional documents

[Contact Support] button
```

---

### **Step 4: Doctor Logs In**

```
Doctor dashboard shows verification badge:

If status = 'pending':
⏳ Verification Pending
"Your account is under review. You'll receive an email once complete."
[Yellow badge]

If status = 'approved':
✅ Verified Doctor
"Your credentials have been verified. Full access granted."
[Green badge]

If status = 'declined':
❌ Verification Declined
"Your verification was not approved. Contact support."
[Red badge]
```
